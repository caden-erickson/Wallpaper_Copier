# Wallpaper Copier
 Personal project

This batch script automates the process of retrieving Windows lock screen photos (specific to my machine, sorry).  
  
Windows stores lock screen images as generic files buried deep in AppData, and if I ever want to save one for future use, it's a pain to go in and convert every file to see which one I want, and then move it. This simple script automates that process, and copies all the converted images into a folder on my desktop.
